# Send and Receive Data from Server
This is a basic example of How to Send and Receive data from an Online Server using an Android App.

Note:
For this app to work you need some PHP files in your server that will pass and receive the data from the
app as and when the Android App makes the requests.

In the Sample Project you will find the PHP files included for a sample server.

How to use:
1. Replace the Database name, password, username and Server name in the PHP files with yours.
2. Replace the Database attributes with yours. (Eg. In the sample Project four attributes are present in the database(name,password,contact,country))
3. Paste the given PHP files in your server's public folder.
4. In the Java files replace the URL of the PHP files with yours.
5. Show the data as your wish.
6. All Done!
